# Data Analysis Projects in R

This repository contains comprehensive data analysis projects using R, focusing on both univariate and multivariate analysis techniques across multiple datasets from R's built-in datasets package.

## Project Overview

This project explores four different datasets using statistical analysis methods including:
- Univariate analysis
- Multivariate analysis
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Regression modeling
